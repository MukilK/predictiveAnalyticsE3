## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots
```{r}
Auto = read.table("H:/Move to new laptop 20190605/Personal/PMBA/Fall 2019/Predictive Analysis/Grp 1/Auto.data",header = T, na.strings = "?")
Auto = na.omit(Auto)
fix(Auto)
summary(Auto)

#Question a
# Quanitative Predictors - "mpg","cylinders","displacement", "horsepower", "weight", "acceleration", "year"
# Qualitative Predictors - "origin", "name" 

#Question b
sapply(Auto[,-c(8,9)], range)

#Question c
sapply(Auto[,-c(8,9)], mean)
sapply(Auto[,-c(8,9)], sd)

#Question d
Autonew = Auto[-c(10:85), ]
sapply(Autonew[,-c(8,9)], range)
sapply(Autonew[,-c(8,9)], mean)
sapply(Autonew[,-c(8,9)], sd)

#Question e
attach(Auto)
plot(Auto)
plot(origin,year) 
  # We see no relation with country of origin to year of manufacturing.
hist(origin) 
  # Here we see about 250 data points belong to America as country of origin. However only 60 and 70 belong to Europe and Japan, respectively.
plot(mpg,year) 
  # We see some correlation in MPG and year of manufacturing. There is gradual improvement in the MPG over the 12 years starting in 70's.
plot(mpg,acceleration) 
  # We do not see direct correlation in MPG and acceleration.
plot(mpg,displacement) 
  # We see some correlation in MPG and displacement. Cars with high displacement have low MPG.

#Question f
plot(mpg,cylinders) 
  # We see direct correlation in MPG and number of cylinders. As the number of cylinders increase the MPG goes down.
boxplot(mpg~origin) 
  # We see direct correlation in MPG and the country of origin. Cars with country of origin as Japan (3) have a higer MPG range. 
plot(mpg,weight) 
  # We see direct correlation in MPG and weight. As the weight increase the MPG goes down.
plot(mpg,horsepower) 
  # We see direct correlation in MPG and horsepower As the horsepower increase the MPG goes down. 
plot(mpg,year) 
  # We see some correlation in MPG and year of manufacturing. There is gradual improvement in the MPG over the 12 years starting in 70's.
  # Predictors for MPG are 
  #   1) Cylinders
  #   2) origin
  #   3) weight
  #   4) horsepower
  #   5) year

[1] "mpg"          "cylinders"    "displacement" "horsepower"  
[5] "weight"       "acceleration" "year"         "origin"      
[9] "name"  
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
